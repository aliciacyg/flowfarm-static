# 🍽️ FlowFarm Static Prototype

**FlowFarm** is an educational aquaponics simulation game where you manage a small deep-water culture aquaponics system. Balance water chemistry, care for fish and plants, complete community requests, and learn about sustainable food production. Try the game [here!](https://aliciacyg.github.io/flowfarm-static/)

## 🧾 Purpose

This version was developed for design and user testing purposes, as part of my team's senior Human-Computer Interaction capstone.

The final game will follow FlowFarm's design.
